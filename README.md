# my-numerical-analysis-course-ex5
Created matlab/octave codes to be used in Lab 4 of numerical analysis course. However, this is still in Indonesian language.  This exercise is about numerical methods to solve large system of linear equations using iteration methods such as Jacobi and Gauss Seidel methods.
The file ex5.m is the main file of this exercise. It contains information on how to do this exercise.
